## Selected Dribbble project

**Dribbble URL**: https://dribbble.com/shots/2905982-Marketing-Page-Exercise

*We're keen to know which Dribbble you selected, and the thinking behind that
decision. Write a few notes here about your choice, and why you chose it here.*

There wasn't a decision to choose per se. :)

## Installation

To setup this project and install it's tools/dependencies, if any, run the
following command(s):

```
None needed. For speed, kept the build to simple HTML and Sass/CSS.

```

## Running locally

To run this project locally as a static-webpage, run the following command(s):

```
In context of speed, it's super simple, Open browser, drop index.html into it. Mobile/tablet optimization is not established. View at your own risk.

```

## Future improvements

*We recognize that building a beautiful and convincing website is not a
simple or speedy task, which is why we'd like to see what future
improvements you would suggest to get this project to a 100% production
ready state. No suggestion is a bad one, and we welcome every detail you
provide.*

Ideally, the following would need to occur:

- Sketch file of design
	- makes exporting images/svgs easier
	- allows for more accurate redlining
	- allows better establihsing of font sizes
	- establishes a tighter picture of the design's width

- Better consistency in regards to padding
- Know where this will ultimately be residing to then templatize this accordingly. (i.e., middleman/AWS, CMS, etc...)
- Have access to the correct font. (Per findings, looks like it's Avenir which I don't own,)
- Knowledge of if the form is coming from a specific source (i.e., Hubspot, Marketo, etc..). This will need to be reworked since those providers build forms differently.
- If this design is using previous established design elements/components.
- Will it need to adjust for A/B testing. If so, what tool is being used to add in the code and adjust accordingly.
- What are the intentions/goals for this when seen on tablet/mobile? Will the design/messaging alter per orientation and/or device?
- Pending analytics driving the creation of this page, how much/how little animation can be setup and used?
- Do we want to set a color scheme (i.e., color blindness) for accessibility purposes?
- Perhaps setting up a slideshow for the tesimonial section mixed with some video based testimonials?
- Need to establish more CTAs to take advantage of the user's interest in any of the sections.
- Do we want to introduce a slide-in top banner for last minute announcements?
