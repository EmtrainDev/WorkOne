JS EXERCISE: Power Generator

The people at the Hoover Dam have called you back, and would like a program that shows what happens when only the even numbered turbines are turned on. And they want it all in just one for loop.
With a set of complex conditional statements inside the loop, construct a way to only turn on even numbered turbines. Remember our power output situation:

o    Generators 1 through 4 produce 62 MW.
o    Generators 5 through 19 produce 124 MW.
The output should follow this format:

Generator #1 is off.
Generator #2 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 62 MW!
Weâ€™ve given you some starting variables to use in your build. Within your loop, consider the possible scenarios when building your conditions:

o    The Generator provides 62 MW of power.
o    The Generator provides 124 MW of power.
o    The Generator is off.
