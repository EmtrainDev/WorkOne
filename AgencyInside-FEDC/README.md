Front End Dev Challenge README ::

Production/QA Approach :

After examining both psd files of the designs for desktop and mobile, I began my initial HTML building basic blocks of header, section and footer, preparing them for content. Once the basic layout was setup via both HTML and CSS, I began adding in content from top to bottom, cross-checking elements against the psd files. Once a 'block' was built and tested, across my initial pre-device check, I would move onto the next 'block'. 

Upon completing the desktop view build and having cross-checked the HTML/CSS design against the psd file, I began work on the mobile view build. Establishing an intial viewpoint (width) break of 950px (max) and 320px (min), I started the mobile view CSS design edits while constantly checking against the initial desktop design to track any bugs/defects that may have carried over.

Once my first mobile build was complete, I then began checking the mobile CSS design via the mobile emulators as well as the devices that I have on hand, to cross-check and find bugs/defects. I also began doing web page performance tests to round out my QA tests.

The device QA phase took about half the time as actual production, if not a little longer, just to make sure that I could test as many scenarios as possible to offest having any bugs showing.

On completing my QA, I fully optimized the jpeg being used and minified both the CSS and HTML. The final versions went through one last web performance test, links to the results are included below.
